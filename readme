 Polity is a grand strategy, turn-based tile-map game. Polities grow in accordance with their own situations, players can influence and intervene in a limited way to see their Polity expand, develop and thrive- avoiding conquest or destruction by other Polities, or being ripped apart by centrifugal forces acting from within.
